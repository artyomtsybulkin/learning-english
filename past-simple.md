# Past simple Tense notes

## Very often the past simple ends in -ed (*regular* verbs)

1. I work in a travel agency now. Before that I **worked** in a department store.
2. We **invited** them to our party, but they **decided** not to come.
3. he police **stopped** me on my way home last night.
4. Laura **passed** her examination because she **studied** very hard.

But many verbs are *irregular*. The past simple does not end in **-ed**. For example:
|Present|Past|
|:--|:--|
|write|wrote|
|see|saw|
|go|went|
|shut|shut|

1. Mozart **wrote** more than 600 pieces of music.
2. We **saw** Rose in town a few days ago.
3. I **went** to the cinema three times last week.
4. It was cold, so I **shut** the window.

In questions and negatives we use did/didn't + infinitive (enjoy/see/go etc.):
|||
|:--|:--|
|I|enjoyed|
|she|saw|
|they|went|

||||
|:--|:--|:--|
||you|enjoy?|
|did|she|see?|
||they|go?|

||||
|:--|:--|:--|
|I||enjoy|
|she|didn't|see|
|they||go|

1. **Did** you **go** out last night? 
Yes, I **went** to the cinema, but I **didn't enjoy** the film much.
2. When **did** Mr Thomas **die**? About ten years ago.
3. They **didn't invite** her to the party, so she **didn't go**.
4. **Did** you **have** time to write the letter?" "No, I **didn't.**"

In the following examples, do is the main verb in the sentence (did ... do / didn't do):

1. What **did** you **do** at the weekend? (not What did you at the weekend?)
2. I **didn't do** anything. (not I didn't anything)

The past of be (am/is/are) is was/were:

* I / he / she / it **was/wasn't**
* we / you / they **were/weren't**
* **was** I / he / she / it ?
* **were** we / you / they ?

> Note that we do not use **did** in negatives and questions with **was / were**

1. I was angry because they **were** late.
2. Was the weather good when you **were** on holiday?
3. They **weren't** able to come because they were so busy.
4. Did you go out last night or **were** you too tired?
